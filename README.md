## **Hello :love_letter: I'm Sharon!** 

### **About Me**

**Junior Sales Support Executive**

- Managing sales support activities, including data handling and administrative tasks, with a focus on improving operational efficiency

& An aspiring Data/Software Engineer ***(open to both career pathways)***  with a growing skill set in Python & SQL :nerd_face:

**Experience**

**Code First Girls**
- Intro to Python
- Intro to SQL
- Intro to Java

**Codeacademy**
- Python 3 - (Relevant project: Len's Slice. Utilised my knowledge of Python lists to organise sales data for an imaginary pizza place in New York :pizza:)
- SQL

**Len's Slice Project Overview**

This project allowed me to put into practice my understanding of how lists work.

1. Compiled a list of available pizza slice toppings and established pricing for each topping option
2. Calculated the total number of available toppings and stored the result in a variable
3. Printed a message confirming the number of toppings offered for customer awareness
4. Created a two-dimensional list pairing each topping with its corresponding price and sorted this in ascending order
5. Simulated customer orders by adding and removing items from the list to determine least popular pizza slice toppings
6. Generated a report revealing  which pizza slices remained unsold at the end of the day   

The block of code below for example demonstrates how I utilised _slicing_ in this project:   

```
# Slice the list leaving only the unsold pizza slices to determine least popular pizza slice toppings
unsold_pizza = pizza_and_prices[:3]
print(unsold_pizza)
```

***Confession...*** this is my first time using Git & GitHub :hand_over_mouth:

But, already I can see how useful it'll be for collaborating with my instructors and peers during the CFGDegree Autumn 2024 

In assignment 1, I believe the main purposes for using Git & GitHub are:

- Learning to create and store directories and files locally onto our devices
- Learning to document our work and tracking changes over time 
- Demonstrating key Git & GitHub commands such as branching, committing changes, and creating pull and push requests
- Developing skills in collaborating and sharing work remotely

How am I coping, you ask?
