**Len's Slice Project Overview**

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a CFG project, but still useful to share.

This project allowed me to put into practice my understanding of how lists work.

1. Compiled a list of available pizza slice toppings and established pricing for each topping option
2. Calculated the total number of available toppings and stored the result in a variable
3. Printed a message confirming the number of toppings offered for customer awareness
4. Created a two-dimensional list pairing each topping with its corresponding price and sorted this in ascending order
5. Simulated customer orders by adding and removing items from the list to determine least popular pizza slice toppings
6. Generated a report revealing  which pizza slices remained unsold at the end of the day   

The block of code below for example demonstrates how I utilised _slicing_ in this project:   

```
# Slice the list leaving only the unsold pizza slices to determine least popular pizza slice toppings
unsold_pizza = pizza_and_prices[:3]
print(unsold_pizza)
```

***Fun fact...*** this is actually my first time using Git & GitHub :hand_over_mouth:

Can you tell? _I hope not!_ Anyways, below is a quick breakdown of how I plan to use Git & GitHub for my first assignment

- [x] Create a GitHub account and a private repository called 'CFG-Assignments'
- [x] Clone this private repository onto my local device and create a README.md file
- [x] Demonstrate Git commands like checking the status, creating branches, committing changes
- [x] Creating additional files explaining git concepts
